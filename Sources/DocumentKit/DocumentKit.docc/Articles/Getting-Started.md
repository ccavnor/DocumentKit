The biggest problems with `DocumentGroup`-based apps, is that the native APIs for integrating with the document browser is very limited.

Furthermore, the `DocumentGroup` is not a view, and only lets you define views for your documents, which means that it's hard to present initial onboardings when a user opens the app for the first time.
